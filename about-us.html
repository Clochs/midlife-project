        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>My name is Sam, I am 45 at the time of writing this. I am an alchoholic in recovery for 5 1/2 years. I say this because it is a huge part of my life and story. Most of my life was spent trying to be the man I thought I should be while at the same time succumbing to alchoholism. Since my mid twenties I have been involved in some sort of mechanics. I thought thats what I was supposed to be, I had to work on automobiles because thats what men do. The point being, I never took the time or made the effort to see what I really wanted to do with my life. Looking back I did this for a few reasons: one being, I did not think I was smart enough to have a white collar career. Don't get me wrong, some of the smartest people I have ever met in my life were mechanics, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that as a career. In hindsight for me, it was not my true passion, especially working on cars.</p>
